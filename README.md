# ChatbotFX
A JavaFX application that performs the same tasks as Chatbot(Swing), but with better GUI and more features. ChatbotFX returns and talks about information input by the user, has file saving and loading capabilities, and utilizes the Twitter4J API.


   As the program starts, ChatbotFX will ask you for your name. Type it in the text field and
hit OK. Then the main interface opens up. The Map button opens up a Google Map in a new window,
 see if you can find where you currently are! The Calendar button opens up a fully functional calendar
in which you can save agendas. Everything is saved so long as the window and the main application remain
running. On the right corner of the window is the ChatArea, which will display your conversation with
ChatbotFX. The load button opens a file chooser for you to open and display a text file in the
 ChatArea. The conversation is saved to a file named ChatbotFXFile.txt. Opening it will open the conversation
file in the ChatArea when it was last saved. The save button saves the conversation file in your workspace.
Otherwise, search your computer for the file location. The Topic List Button opens up a table which lists
all the topics ChatbotFX can talk about. ChatbotFX has 30 unique responses, there are 10 items in each of
the 29 topics. Type in the items in the ChatField at the top of the window, then hit the chat button. Responses
are listed in the ChatArea. Typing in the same ChatField and hitting the Send Tweet button Sends a tweet and
shows the tweet you posted in a new window(Use with Caution). Typing in the ChatField and clicking the search button shows
ten topics based on the category you searched. Make sure to save your conversation before clicking the
Quit button, which will have ChatbotFX say goodbye and close the program.
NOTICE: It's best to download the src and run ChatbotFX in an IDE(preferably Eclipse). This will allow ChatbotFXFile.txt to be created inside your workspace, where it was intended to be found.
Running ChatbotFX inside Eclipse requires this plugin: http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html
The Calendar Interface is free for a limited time, but after a while will require a license key or a buying option.
